# j-euro-dollar
Jupyter notebook of the Euro-Dollar project

## Overview
This notebook shows my work in completing a guided project through Dataquest. The project outline is described in the top section of the notebook. 
The goal of this project was to practice the skills needed to create readable and visually-appealing line graphs all within Python. Specifically, matplotlib was used. 
Notably, the final graph is shown at the bottom of the notebook.
